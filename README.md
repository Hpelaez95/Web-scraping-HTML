# Web-scraping-HTML
added the code to the challenge.
part 1 has all of the data scrapped and attached to a list. I printed it out multiple times through out to verify that it was being scrapped correctly.
In the second part of the mars weather challenge I scrapped the table using pandas so some of the asks in the notebook werent answered because they were already completed in the initital scrape.
